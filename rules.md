As a reminder, we additionally do enforce ResetEra policies and decisions here on the Discord. We request that you treat the members on the forums in a positive fashion. Disagreeing with someone is absolutely acceptable. Attacking them, however, will result in administrative actions.

## Positive Community Interaction 

Welcoming New Members
Part of keeping a community friendly and helping it grow involves being an example to others. When you notice a new user in the discord ( via user-log -channel ) and many times evidenced by a white (non-role'd) username, say hi and welcome them to the community. Even if you have nothing else to say, that initial interaction is important for new members to feel welcomed.

Helpful Members
Most of our members are good citizens here on discord, and will do their best to participate properly. We do recognize that some users, however, will go above and beyond what is expected. We take pride in recognizing and encourage these members to keep doing what they do. Active helpful users may be given additional user roles, which may allow them additional chat powers.

Heated, difficult, non-productive discussion
If discussion in a channel or forum thread becomes potentially confrontational, please do not resort to"attacking" other users in place of their ideas. Failure to do so will result in  moderators likely  stepping in. Many times, a simple reminder is enough to solve the issue. We highly value differing opinions and do not expect everyone to agree on everything. We do, however, expect our community members to act on good faith and not simply attempt to antagonize other members... here or on the ERA forums.
